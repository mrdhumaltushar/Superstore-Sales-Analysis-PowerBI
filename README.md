## 📖 Project Overview
This portfolio project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence solution analyzing a retail superstore's performance. The goal was to transform raw sales data into an interactive visual story that identifies profit-draining products and regional growth opportunities.

## 🔍 Business Problem
The Superstore dataset showed high revenue numbers, but profitability was inconsistent. The business needed to visualize **Sales vs. Profit** to pinpoint exactly where money was being lost despite high transaction volumes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Process
* **Microsoft Power BI**: Used for the final dashboard interface and interactivity.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Calculated complex measures including:
    * *Profit Margin %*
    * *Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth*
    * *Moving Averages*
* **Power Query**: Performed ETL to clean null values and standardize geographic data.
