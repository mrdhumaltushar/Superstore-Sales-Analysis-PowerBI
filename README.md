## 📖 Project Overview
This portfolio project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence solution analyzing a retail superstore's performance. The goal was to transform raw sales data into an interactive visual story that identifies profit-draining products and regional growth opportunities.

## 🔍 Business Problem
The Superstore dataset showed high revenue numbers, but profitability was inconsistent. The business needed to visualize **Sales vs. Profit** to pinpoint exactly where money was being lost despite high transaction volumes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Process
* **Microsoft Power BI**: Used for the final dashboard interface and interactivity.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Calculated complex measures including:
    * *Profit Margin %*
    * *Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth*
    * *Moving Averages*
* **Power Query**: Performed ETL to clean null values and standardize geographic data.

## 💡 Key Insights Uncovered
* **The "Furniture" Trap**: While the Furniture category drives high revenue, the "Tables" sub-category operates at a net loss due to excessive discounting.
* **Regional Strategy**: The **West** region is the top performer. The **South** region requires a review of shipping costs, which are eating into margins.
* **Seasonality**: Historical data shows a consistent sales spike in **Q4 (Oct-Dec)**, indicating a need for inventory stockpiling in late Q3.
